== 2 Structures

What a structure is, how they are declared, typedef, etc.

=== 2.1. Defining Structures

A structure is a collection of some number of variables, not necessarily of the same type.

=== 2.2 How to Declare a Structure

Consider the fields required to store a data: day, month, and year. A `struct` to hold these pieces of information could be declared as follows:

[source]
----
struct date {int day,month,year;};
----

The keyword `struct` is followed by the name given to the structure (date). Alternatively, we can declare each field separately.

[source]
----
struct date{
    int day;
    int month;
    int year;
};
----

Especially when the types field data vary, the second option is much clearer.
